# Credit Risk Classification using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project implements a credit risk assessment system using **Logistic Regression** to classify loan applications as 'healthy' or 'high-risk'. The model uses advanced data preprocessing techniques including oversampling to handle class imbalance, achieving excellent performance with 99%+ accuracy. The system includes a user-friendly Streamlit web application for real-time credit risk assessment.

## Key Features
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Interpretable and reliable binary classification
- **Advanced Data Handling**: RandomOverSampler to address severe class imbalance
- **High Performance**: 99%+ accuracy with balanced precision and recall
- **Interactive Web App**: Streamlit-based interface for real-time predictions
- **Production Ready**: Complete model serialization and deployment architecture

## Dataset
The analysis uses lending data with 77,536 loan records containing:
- **Features**: 7 financial indicators (loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt)
- **Target**: Binary classification (0 = healthy loan, 1 = high-risk loan)
- **Class Distribution**: Highly imbalanced dataset (96.7% healthy vs 3.3% high-risk loans)

## Methodology

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Applied RandomOverSampler to balance the dataset
- **Train-Test Split**: 75% training, 25% testing with stratified sampling
- **Feature Standardization**: Optimized feature scaling for logistic regression

### 2. Model Implementation
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression with L2 regularization
- **Optimization**: Trained on balanced dataset using oversampling
- **Hyperparameters**: Default scikit-learn parameters with random_state=1 for reproducibility

### 3. Model Evaluation
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV for robust performance estimation
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, ROC AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Performance Analysis**: Detailed classification reports and confusion matrices

## Results

### Model Performance
| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Test Accuracy | 99.42% | Overall prediction accuracy |
| ROC AUC | 0.9945 | Excellent discrimination ability |
| CV Score | 0.9947 Â± 0.0006 | Consistent cross-validation performance |
| Precision (Healthy) | 99% | Accuracy in predicting healthy loans |
| Precision (High-Risk) | 99% | Accuracy in predicting high-risk loans |
| Recall (Healthy) | 99% | Detection rate of healthy loans |
| Recall (High-Risk) | 99% | Detection rate of high-risk loans |

### Key Insights
- **Excellent Performance**: 99%+ accuracy across all key metrics
- **Balanced Classification**: Equal precision and recall for both loan types
- **Class Balance Impact**: Oversampling dramatically improved high-risk loan detection
- **Model Reliability**: Consistent performance across cross-validation folds
